<h3>8/30</h3>

<p>This week, Downing introduced us to some C++ code. So far, it has just been syllabus and basic code, but I have high expectations for this class since I've heard good things about it in the past. I'm expecting to learn C++ and have a solid understanding of how it differs from Java, and when/where I should be using the language.</p>

<p>Object oriented programming can be useful to me in the future. I believe that future employees will value the skills that I will receive in this class, since OOP is very prevalent in today's industry.</p>
