<h3>8/30</h3>

<p>This week, Downing introduced us to some C++ code. So far, it has just been syllabus and basic code, but I have high expectations for this class since I've heard good things about it in the past. I'm expecting to learn C++ and have a solid understanding of how it differs from Java, and when/where I should be using the language.</p>

<p>Object oriented programming can be useful to me in the future. I believe that future employees will value the skills that I will receive in this class, since OOP is very prevalent in today's industry.</p>

<p>I missed quite a few questions on the recent quizzes. So far, Downing has taught C++ quite well, going over each line and discussing exactly what everything does. Take good notes! It's nice to learn a language as in-depth as the way Downing is teaching it, and don't feel embarassed when he calls on you and you don't know the answer. I'll guarantee you're not the only clueless one in the room - everyone's learning somethng in Downing's class</p>
