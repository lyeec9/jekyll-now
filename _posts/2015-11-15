<h3>11/15</h3>

<p>I don't feel like I learned much this week in class. Then again, that's probably my own fault since I skipped class on Friday.
Still, we had a guest speaker come in on Monday and we simply learned about the game of life on Monday. The game of life looks like an interesting
project (not that I've begun yet - you should know me by now). Abstraction, extends, etc. are things that I feel like we should've learned
a while ago. Honestly coming into this class, I felt like those were the main first topics that we'd cover and that we'd go over a lot about when/where
we'd want to use them. The class took a little bit of a different direction, and I'm perfectly okay with that.</p>

<p>Atlassian seems like a good company. Having used Jira a lot before in the past, I know most about what they do and I wouldn't mind working 
there. Then again, there's lots of companies out there that I defintely wouldn't mind working for. Whether or not any of them have asked me for 
an interview, however, is a different story. I'm sure that this class looks great on the resume and will definitely help out with that though. That's 
definitely one of the biggest benefits of OOP - the fact that it looks great on your resume.</p>

<p>I hope this project doesn't take as long as the one before it. They both seem pretty similar in complexity, except the last project took me around 16 hours
and I ended up turning it in late (but with extra credit to make up for it), and I hope that this one doesn't end up being too late either. I might
be in for a wild time at the 3rd floor CS lab for the next few days if I'm wrong, but we'll see.</p>

<p>Tip of the week: Don't skip class. Skipped Friday; looked at the notes; slightly confused. Even though I don't feel like I learn a lot in class,
I definitely feel like I miss a lot as soon as I skip.</p>
